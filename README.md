# Y_MRCA-reference-genome
#This repository is for FASTA files containing Y chromosome reference genomes made by altering GRCh38 or GRCh37
#to be a consensus reference for all variant poisitons above M526 haplogroup marker.
#This altered reference is to purge the GRCh38 of its mutations cause by being 70% derived from one male in upstate NY.
#As such it is thought to be the true Y_MRCA reference genome, or the sequence of "Y-chromosome Adam", who actually is Noah.
